# Song Identification
Song clustering is done GTZAN dataset 
Content based clustering is done on one million song dataset having lyrics in it(musicmatch)
Collaborative filtering is applied on one million song dataset providing user taste profile
other data sets provided by one million song are also used like artist, track meta data which are present in db format.

Song based on given song or user is predicted.

Idea was to use the single dataset to work for whole pipeline but was not able to find datset that could do all this.
